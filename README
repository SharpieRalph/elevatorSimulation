# Elevator Simulation Project

## Overview
This project is an elevator simulation developed using Qt Creator and C++ as an assignment for an Object Oriented Software Engineering class.
It aims to simulate the working of an elevator system in a building, showcasing the elevator's movement between floors, handling user requests, and displaying the current status of the elevator.


## Features
- Simulate multiple elevators
- User interface to interact with the elevators
- Real-time display of elevator status

# Demo
