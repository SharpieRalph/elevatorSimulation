I chose to design my assignment that way because I think it would be best to have 2 panels: one representing normally what oustide the elevator and when you decide to enter the elevator, that is when you will see the actual (similar) elevator panel.

Before pressing buttons for calling the elevator, please assign a value to both elevators and which floor you would like the passenger to start off with and press the start button.
